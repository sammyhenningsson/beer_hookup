The wort is not boiling so is not agitating the hops to allow mixing. If the hops aren't steeped properly in the wort you won't get the maximum flavour impact.","contributed_by":"Sam Mason <samjbmason>"},{"id":123,"name":"Candy Kaiser","tagline":"NorDdeutsches Retro Altbier.","first_brewed":"08/2015","description":"In this northern German style retro altbier, we’ve dialled down the dry-hops to zero, but cranked up the malt to create massive aromas.
